# todos-express-starter

Tutorial to practice use of Google sign in.
This tutorial can be found on the documentation site for [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) As such (if you read below) the starter todo app was provided by passport.js tutorials.

I've added in under their guidance, Google and Facebook OAuth2 sign-ins, passport session control and (De)serialization of user sessions.

Thanks,

This is a starter kit for building a todo app with sign in functionality using
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).
